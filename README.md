# Workspace for – A Yellow Raven Book Project 

Version: 2013.04.30a (http://enguindesign.com/journal/articles/2011/07/versioning-revisited/) 

HTML5 Boilerplate Version: 3.0.6

## Overview
This is the basic workspace used in A Yellow Raven books.

## Requirements
- Compass <http://compass-style.org/>
- Compass H5bp gem <https://github.com/sporkd/compass-h5bp>
- ElasticSearch <https://github.com/nickdunn/elasticsearch>
- Useragent details (ayellowraven fork) <https://github.com/ayellowraven/useragent_details>

## Using this template

If you are new to Compass–or need a constant reminder like I do–all you have to do is run `compass watch [myproject]` in the command line and compass will watch and update your css files.

I have included mixins with default settings for 50rem (800px) and 65rem (1040px). However, you can easily set your own breakpoints. I've tried to keep it all documented, and if you want, it is pretty easy to change or update it yourself. I have also included javascript media queries to match the CSS media queries. There is also an example for using jQuery's .attr() method and Symphony's JIT Image Manipulation method for serving responsive images.

Finally, I have not included anything for minimizing your javascript, feel free to do so yourself.

## Templates
The templates in the `symphony-templates/` are meant to replace the files in `/symphony/templates` the main updates are to page.xsl to take advantage of HTML5 elements.
